1. Öjnlike Depot
================

Öjnlike harbour sits in the gut of a natural silt bay, a calm slice of crescent coast supported on both sides by kilometres of barnacled limestone. The harbour and its neighbouring residential streets face nothing to the south but vast uninterrupted low farmland, standing quietly and largely uncultivated except the occasional field bean crop, and all face out towards an interminable and busy sea.

There is a single entrance and exit to the town by road, which runs plumb to the southern horizon, and parallel to the freight rail - many years its senior - that sees far more traffic. The port workers, their patrons, and the residents in the small industry town together count a thousand or so (and represent the entire population of the country’s northernmost *landkreis*) but travellers rarely visit, and the inhabitants rarely travel except for work - work that inevitably involves the shipping of things in and out of the small port harbour.

The harbour itself emanates an interminable sound scape of gulls cawing and waves lapping. Workmen chat, and steel cables clink, as the fishermen unload their catch and other miscellaneous containers are hoisted off of small cargo lighters and onto the freight rail service, which runs day and night, each day of the week, and is the lifeblood of this otherwise quiescent settlement.

Between shipments the port men and women, uniformed in their blue bib overalls, sit against the small fishery cabins that line the outer harbour buttress, and do little more than drink bottled beer by the case. Local faces are dark and weathered, but exude the cheery, unconcerned optimism of folk with hard work and simple aspirations. It's easy to see that the town is best characterised by its trade: each of its compact streets faces inwards towards the port or its depot, and the smells of industry - of the sea, of petroleum, fish, and exhaust - mingle together and pervade throughout the town and, to a lesser extent, the people too. Local spirits rise and fall with the prosperity of their commerce, which in recent years has suffered a slight but noticeable dip - with no consensus among the workers as to why.

Despite it being a focal point to the town, it is a stretch of the definition to call the flat concrete and single rail track at Öjnlike a ‘depot’. Its single defining feature is an outmoded crane, half yellow half rusted, which sits on sunken steel tracks that run between the buffer stop and the jetty. But asides this veteran giant, the establishment - which is demarked on two sides by an also rusted chain-link fence - bears little resemblance to the immense machines found in larger city ports. Concrete slabs pave the entire surface, from the rail entrance to the edge of the jetty, and between each sprouts a meagre tuft of plant life which in places has eroded away what was undoubtedly once a firm foundation.

Multimodal containers, theoretically in a variety of colours though in reality mostly a kind of brown, are stacked two-high on the slabs beside the rail, awaiting the continuation of their international journeys. They are almost exclusively the only passengers on this portion of the rail network, which was built for and is maintained by an age-old local cooperative representing the interests of the commercial port.

When asked for the time of the next arrival, a local worker gave me the sense that workers at Öjnlike treat scheduling with a characteristically laissez-faire attitude. The squat labourer, who appeared to operate some portion of the loading and unloading of containers, stood hunched in his crude, oil tarnished blue overalls, and was preoccupied with the cleaning of some nameless metal component. Squinting in one eye, he studied the item and forced a blackened rag through its centre.

“When one comes it comes” he said, nonchalantly and in a quiet nasal tone. “Sofija calls out the numbers, that’s all I need or care for,” he motioned with the rag, still squinting, to a small working hut. “You should ask her.” Despite his casual manner, some malcontent entered the mix as he said that final word, and - as if on cue - the crest of a wave rode a stray bluster and overtopped the nearby buttress wall. The water slapped down on the worn concrete surface behind him loudly and was still.

"Expecting a storm?" I asked, surprised by the intrusion.

"Nah?" He looked quizzically - first at the sky, then at me. Another crest broke over the wall, but the sky was clear and blue, and it occurred to me that the place must be in chaos in bad weather - if the lightest of breezes would break the sea defences. "Why'd you ask?"

"No reason" I said, and watched the water run over the fragmented concrete and funnel through outlets at the base of the wall. The autumn had chilled the air, but the warm sun evaporated the remaining water quickly, and a gull pecked at something that had carried over with it. I wondered and asked, "How old is this port?"

The man refocussed on his metal component, and this time began attempting to force his little finger through its opening. He inhaled deeply and frowned, as if ready to blow on the part, but instead let out the air through his nose as a long and congested sigh.

"Longer than I have," he said with a dry unenthusiastic wit and paused for a laugh. "But no older than the railway. My ma's ma worked here, moved here, for the work, I mean - but back then there was only maybe few people. All here for the work. That was, what, hmm -" he looked up from his inspection towards the sky and made quiet sounds as he counted to himself. Behind him, a group of three workers, similarly bibbed in blue, passed by carrying thick wet ropes. One casually inspected us as he passed. Or, more likely, inspected the outsider, of which there were clearly few.

"Eighty years ago?" He continued. "She worked on the books - schedules, and finances, that sort of thing - because she had been to school and was smart. I guess before the port was here there was nothing at all." A slight expression of bemused wonder passed over his weather-worn and stubbled face, and lasted briefly before being replaced with that same squint as he pulled up his sleeve.

"Lunchtime" he said at his watch with very little conviction, stowed his oily rag in his bib pocket, tossed the presumably unsalvageable metal component over his shoulder, and left. The part landed with a clink, rolled along the slab and came to rest in a groove, to accompany a withered shrub.

The man left in the direction of the main gate of the enclosed depot, alongside a group of several others who had similarly looked up from their work, to their watches, and joined what soon became a small migration of ten blue-and-black-bibbed workers out of that gate and down the worn track. They flocked diligently inland and with practised routine around the corner, and towards (what I would come to know as) *The Mar*.

2. 1918
============

Rain was beating down and through the broken window panes into the old damn damp bare room in which Friedrich slept on the floor. There was scant left, like in most of the homes abandoned to become buildings that he had seen over the past three months - an old barren rosewood chest with all but a few drawers missing, an overturned rack of shelves and a obliterated mirror against the back wall. The door was broken in its frame where it had been forced open.

Three more lay huddled in heavy coats and dark grey cotton blankets - just as damp - at the edge of the room near Friedrich. Brief plumes of white mist escaped from each of their worn and dirty faces as most of them tried to escape to sleep in the early winter frost. Those that had made it - as Friedrich had - writhed busily, sometimes panicked, as they unconsciously relived trauma. Every one of them kept their rifle close at their side.

The room, which may have been the study of some wealthy lawyer or doctor before it was gutted and deserted (though not necessarily in that order), was miserable but the most like home Friedrich had experienced since a steaming locomotive had taken him from his own. By virtue of its plastered walls and high beamed ceiling, his exhausted sleep here was more sheltered than any he had since then. The sound of shelling echoed in the far distance, but despite his refuge in his dreams Friedrich heard them over and then inside his head. He opened his eyes to the anticlimactic dim stillness of the formerly grand room.

The haze of sleep ascended almost immediately - as if he had barely been asleep at all - and he peered around remembering the cold alien room. This was the second night they had been given leave from the front, but yesterday by some oversight by the ever confused and desperate command they had found no transport and slept in the recesses of an old reserve trench. Now he lay five miles away in a violated old town for relief, and all he could feel was the dread in his chest of his inevitable return.

Rising was the feeble light of early dawn, and from the courtyard outside the shattered window he heard the bustle of confused efficiency as supply transports trundled in from the half-frozen muddy country and were coordinated by frightened men this way and that. A stout officer commanded loudly with false certainty an arriving section. A team of horses - as tired and wary as the men steering them - clopped on the cobbles with a heavy gun in tow. There was a toxic and familiar stench of mud, manure, burnt wood, damp, and cigarette smoke also penetrated up into the room, as two more men - belonging to the same *gruppe* to which Friedrich found his membership (though had never felt *belonging*) - had given up their quest for rest and communed in dry vacant monotone at the base of the building.

"... heard Second *kompanie* moved up to replace them yesterday."
"I thought that was Third."
"No, spoke to someone yesterday from Third. They are down in the valley."
There was silence for a moment as both took a synchronised drag and gazed distractedly at something far away, perhaps daring to imagine the trudging of Third to the godforsaken front. The first man then coughed lightly and gazed up at the the buildings in the courtyard, studying what remained of the battered architecture. None of the baroque and Georgian town houses had a roof or wall without a hole or the char of fire, but were nevertheless impressive put together in this innocent town.

"I think I have been here before."

His brother in arms returned from his gaze and raised an eyebrow. "Really?"

"A very long time ago. It was with my wife, we only stayed briefly - just passed through I think - but I recognise some of the buildings," he motioned down at the dark smoothed cobbles beneath them "and I think you can always tell a place by the stones in the road. Back then it was a happier place. Lively." He looked back to catch the gaze of his comrade. "You know, lively in a different way."

"I don't think I can imagine it." His comrade replied quietly, then frowning: "It hurts to imagine it, Bern."

Ahead of them, soldiers had begun to assemble in the square - as per their orders. Most stuffed and strapped up their bags in silence or muttered quietly, their sleep wearing off as they woke in time to the sun that peered inevitably over the horizon.

"It hurts me too." He watched the soldiers, all of them barely adults, and yet somehow now years older than they had a been a few months ago when they joined the August draft. "And you know, I lied. It wasn't long ago. I was here two years ago. It just feels a lot longer."

Up in the room, Friedrich propped his aching body against the wall, blanket still held close. He put his hands between his thighs to warm them, and watched Peter, who lay facing him, clench his jaw and furrow his brow in his sleep. The boy - for he too was a boy, as they all were - had a slender face and mousy hair, generally in appearance not unlike Friedrich, but large and emotional eyes under a thick brow. Peter had a tenderness that was ill suited to the brutality of wartime, but it had affiliated him with Friedrich who shared his quietude, and drew Friedrich to him - for solace and relief from the rest of the harsh world that had engulfed them a few long months earlier.

A bearded man named Hartmann leaned through the empty doorway and said "Friedrich" quietly. Friedrich turned his aching neck to meet him, and Hartmann told him to get the others up. He spoke sympathetically, or perhaps with pity, smiled respectfully, and disappeared again. Outside, the officer, who believed in doing something wrong with vigour, before doing nothing at all, began again to shout vehemently. Friedrich gently woke Peter and then the others, and with a latent duty they all descended to join the congregation in the courtyard.
